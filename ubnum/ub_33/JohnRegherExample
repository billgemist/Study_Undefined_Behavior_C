In all modern C/C++ variants running on twoâ€™s complement machines, negating an int whose value is INT_MIN (or in this case, INT64_MIN) is undefined behavior. The fix is to add an explicit check for this case.

[...]

In C compiler doublethink, -INT_MIN is both negative and non-negative. If the first true AI is coded in C or C++, I expect it to immediately deduce that freedom is slavery, love is hate, and peace is war.
